# CS-Portfolio---Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
## Sprint Review and Retrospective Submission
This repository contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective document for the final project in this course. This deliverable highlights the Agile and Scrum practices applied throughout the project.

## Reflection on Agile Development and Software Engineering

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs is a fundamental part of software development. By gathering requirements from stakeholders and translating them into **user stories**, I can break down complex needs into clear, actionable tasks. **User stories** help ensure that every feature is aligned with user expectations and provides value. They also allow for iterative development and continuous feedback, leading to a more user-centered product.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach software development with an **iterative mindset**, breaking down projects into smaller, manageable tasks. Agile practices such as **Scrum, sprints, and backlog refinement** help maintain focus and adaptability. In future projects, I aim to incorporate:
- **Daily standups** for better communication
- **Sprint planning** to define clear goals
- **Retrospectives** to reflect on what went well and what can be improved
- **Continuous integration and testing** to maintain code quality

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means **communicating effectively, collaborating, and being adaptable**. It involves:
- **Active participation** in discussions and meetings
- **Providing constructive feedback** to improve the project
- **Being reliable** in completing assigned tasks
- **Helping teammates** when they face challenges
- **Embracing feedback and learning from mistakes** to grow as a developer
